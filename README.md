        <h2>General EDI Questions</h2>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>1. What is EDI and how does it work?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is the exchange of business documents in a standard electronic format between trading partners. It replaces traditional paper-based communications such as purchase orders, invoices, and shipping notices. EDI works by using standardized formats like ANSI X12 or EDIFACT, allowing different companies to exchange data efficiently and accurately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>2. What are some common EDI standards used in the industry?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Some of the most common EDI standards include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ANSI X12</strong>: Predominantly used in North America.</li>
                    <li><strong>EDIFACT</strong>: An international standard used globally.</li>
                    <li><strong>TRADACOMS</strong>: Used in the UK for retail and supply chain industries.</li>
                    <li><strong>UBL</strong>: The Universal Business Language, mainly used in e-commerce.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

    <section id="edi-transaction-sets">
        <h2>EDI Transaction Sets</h2>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>3. What is the purpose of EDI 850 (Purchase Order) and EDI 810 (Invoice)?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> EDI 850 is used to create and send a purchase order, while EDI 810 is used to send invoices. These are among the most commonly used EDI transaction sets in the retail and logistics industries. EDI 850 includes details of the items being purchased, quantities, and prices, while EDI 810 includes the details of the items being invoiced, payment terms, and shipping information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>4. How does an EDI 856 (Advance Ship Notice) relate to an EDI 810 (Invoice)?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The EDI 856 (Advance Ship Notice) is used to notify the buyer that the goods are about to be shipped. It contains details such as shipping instructions, item details, and tracking numbers. The EDI 810 (Invoice), on the other hand, is a bill for the goods that have been shipped and includes details like quantities, prices, and payment terms. These two transaction sets are closely linked, as the 856 provides the buyer with shipping information prior to receiving the invoice.</p>
